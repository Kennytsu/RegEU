# EUgene 🇪🇺

**Your Personal AI Compliance Officer**

Never miss another EU regulation. Never face another surprise fine. EUgene monitors thousands of EU legislative files, understands your business, and alerts you only when it matters—before deadlines, not after.

---

## The Problem

European companies face an impossible challenge: staying compliant with rapidly evolving EU regulations across dozens of areas—GDPR, AI Act, Cybersecurity (NIS2), Anti-Money Laundering, ESG reporting, and more.

The consequences of missing updates are severe:
- **€20 million or 4% of global revenue** for GDPR violations
- **€35 million or 7% of global revenue** for AI Act violations
- Reputational damage and loss of customer trust
- Operational disruptions from last-minute compliance scrambles

But tracking these regulations manually is overwhelming. Legislative files are scattered across EU portals, written in dense legal language, and change status without warning. Most companies only learn about new requirements when it's too late.

---

## The Solution

**EUgene** is an AI-powered regulatory intelligence platform that automatically detects, aggregates, and notifies you about relevant EU regulations—tailored specifically to your company.

Think of Eugene as your dedicated compliance officer who:
- **Monitors** thousands of EU legislative files 24/7
- **Filters** only regulations that affect your industry and business model
- **Alerts** you when critical changes happen—via dashboard, email, or voice call
- **Explains** complex regulations in plain language
- **Recommends** immediate actions with specific deadlines

---

## How It Works

### 1️⃣ **Smart Onboarding**
Just enter your company website. EUgene's AI analyzes your business—what you do, your industry, the technologies you use—and automatically identifies which regulatory topics you need to track:

- **AI Act** (if you develop AI/ML products)
- **GDPR** (data protection—applies to almost everyone)
- **BaFin** (financial services regulation)
- **AMLR** (Anti-Money Laundering Rules)
- **Cybersecurity** (NIS2 Directive)
- **ESG** (Environmental, Social, Governance reporting)
- And more...

No manual tagging. No guesswork. Just intelligent profiling.

### 2️⃣ **Continuous Monitoring**
EUgene automatically scrapes the EU Legislative Observatory every week, tracking:
- Legislative status and progress through EU institutions
- Committee assignments and key decision-makers
- Important dates and events
- Status changes that require your attention

Your personalized dashboard shows:
- **Total tracked items** relevant to your business
- **Active legislation** in progress
- **Recent updates** from the last 30 days
- **Topic breakdown** showing your regulatory exposure
- **Activity charts** highlighting the most active areas

### 3️⃣ **Visual Legislative Board**
See the entire EU legislative pipeline at a glance with our Kanban-style board:

```
Preparatory → Committee Review → 1st Reading → 2nd Reading → Vote → Final Stage → Completed
```

Each regulation is a card you can click to explore:
- Full legislative details
- Current status and timeline
- Links to official EU documents
- Committee and rapporteur information

Filter by keyword, committee, year, or your specific topics. Subscribe to individual regulations to get notified of changes.

### 4️⃣ **AI-Powered Voice Calls**
Here's where EUgene truly shines. When a regulation you're tracking hits a critical milestone or deadline, **EUgene calls you**.

Not an email you might miss. Not a dashboard notification. A real voice call.

EUgene explains:
- **What changed** ("The AI Act just moved to 2nd reading")
- **Why it matters** ("You have 18 months to update your data processing systems")
- **The consequences** ("€35M fine or 7% of revenue for non-compliance")
- **What to do next** ("Start a GDPR audit by Q2 2026")

You can ask follow-up questions in natural conversation. EUgene is urgent but professional, specific not generic, and always action-focused.
